Production Optimization Using Techno Plant Simulation
Overview

This repository presents a simulation-based approach to optimizing production processes in industrial settings. By leveraging techno-economic modeling, the project aims to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve overall system performance.

Features

Techno-Economic Modeling: Integrates economic considerations into the simulation to assess cost-effectiveness.

Process Optimization: Identifies optimal operating conditions and configurations for production systems.

Scenario Analysis: Evaluates different scenarios to understand potential outcomes and risks.

Data Visualization: Provides graphical representations of simulation results for better decision-making.

Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher

Required Python packages:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scipy

pyomo (for optimization modeling)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rafianahmed/Production-Optimization-using-Techno-Plant-Simulation.git
cd Production-Optimization-using-Techno-Plant-Simulation


Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`


Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Production-Optimization-using-Techno-Plant-Simulation


Run the main simulation script:

python main.py


This will execute the simulation and generate output files in the output/ directory.

Analyze the results using the provided Jupyter notebooks:

jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb


This will open a Jupyter notebook in your default web browser, where you can explore the simulation results.
